design of the bot

randomly generate the first index and use that to do the initial game

path through all of the initial circle and revealed squares
identify all of the "corner 1's" to use

given a known mine location, 
  if an adjacent unmarked location is touching a 1, than the unmarked location is not a mine



  given a mine location as an input

  access the 8 sorrunding tiles. store the ones = 1 in a revealed tally
