design of the bot

randomly generate the first index and use that to do the initial game

path through all of the initial circle and revealed squares
identify all of the "corner 1's" to use

given a known mine location, 
  if an adjacent unmarked location is touching a 1, than the unmarked location is not a mine



  given a mine location as an input

  access the 8 sorrunding tiles. store the ones = 1 in a revealed tally

if board[i-1][j-1] ==



// all bot code should exist here; the entire point should be to calculate
// the inputs for row and columns

// store a map of saved moves
// while loop to mark them as flags

// find the safe moves
// while loop to reveal them

// check if the game is over
// if no, then repeat

// end bot code

// }

// until games over
// calculate squares to input
// run through inputs until out

// CODE WAS HERE
