# Terminal Minesweeper with AI Bot

üïπÔ∏è **Welcome to Minesweeper!**

This project is a C++ terminal-based Minesweeper clone with an AI bot that strives to find and execute moves autonomously. ü§ñ Please note that the project is a work in progress, and is undergoing active development.

## Features

- **AI Bot Integration**: The game boasts an AI bot that autonomously discovers moves.
- **Still in Development**: This project is a labor of love, evolving continually.
- **User Interaction**: If the bot halts or faces challenges, users can take over and make moves manually.

## Getting Started

To dive into the game:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Compile the C++ code.
4. Run the executable to unleash the gaming experience.

Please note: The AI may not always make optimal moves due to ongoing improvements. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued! üí°
